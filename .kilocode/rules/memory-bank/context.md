- Automatic session recovery and QR code generation
- Group management and messaging
- Error resilience including PreKeyError handling
- Professional reporting with sender information extraction

## Next Steps

The API is feature-complete for the initial requirements with enhanced AI and media capabilities. Potential future enhancements could include:

- Database integration for message persistence and reporting history
- Multiple WhatsApp instance support
- Webhook integration for real-time notifications
- Advanced media message support (videos, documents, audio)
- Advanced group management features
- Custom trigger creation through API
- Report export functionality (PDF, Excel)
- Multi-language support for timestamps and responses
- AI model fine-tuning and custom prompts
- Batch image processing capabilities

- All endpoints tested and functional
- AI functions working correctly with OpenRouter
- Image upload integration tested and operational
- Message age filtering now properly prevents spam responses
- Sender information extraction working correctly for both personal and group messages
- Enhanced .a1 trigger system fully operational

## Recent Bug Fixes

### Message Age Filter (September 2025)

- **Issue**: Old messages (>60s) were logged as "ignored" but still triggered responses and webhooks
- **Root Cause**: Logic flaw where `return null` didn't prevent trigger processing in batch operations
- **Solution**: Enhanced logic to mark old messages as read but skip all trigger processing and storage
- **Result**: Old messages now properly marked as read without triggering any automated responses

### Group Phone Number Extraction (September 2025)

- **Issue**: Group messages showed incorrect phone numbers (group IDs or invalid numbers) in webhook payloads
- **Root Cause**: Using wrong field `participant` instead of `participantPn` for phone number extraction
- **Solution**: Updated extraction logic to prioritize `participantPn` field which contains actual sender phone numbers
- **Result**: Webhook payloads now show correct phone numbers for group message senders

### Enhanced Debugging (September 2025)

- **Added**: Comprehensive batch processing logs to track message handling
- **Added**: Detailed message age filtering logs with timestamps
- **Added**: Phone number validation and extraction method logging
- **Added**: Clear distinction between processed vs skipped messages
